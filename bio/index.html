            <div class="third-width">
              <p>My name is Jade MacRury and I am a unifier, able to see the different strands in a situation, and reason out a way to draw them together. I believe every experience, no matter how mundane, brings something of value and that life needs to be experienced in order to be lived.
                <br><br>
                To this end, I have collected experiences. Thirteen years in customer service. Two years in official and eleven in unofficial but equally relevant IT support roles. I've been a leader, a teacher, a coach, a writer, an editor, a photojournalist, a student, a mentee, a researcher.

              <p>I'm an extensive traveller, a dreamer and a dreamcatcher - having gone to nearly every single country I've dreamed of visiting as a child and achieved nearly every single dream.
                <br><br>
                My experiences provide a rich tapestry of inspiration for all of my creations. If you are like me or you love what I create, hit me a message and let me bring your dreams to life.</p>
