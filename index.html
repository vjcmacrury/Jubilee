            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I&apos;ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I&apos;ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

              <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
